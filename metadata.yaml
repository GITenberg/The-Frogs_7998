description: Losing all faith in humanity, and their basest incarnation, the tragedians,
  Dionysos, god of the theatre, vows to go to the underworld to revive the greatest
  tragedian of all, the barely cold Euripides, who had died the year before. Enlisting
  his servant Xanthias, and asking his half brother Herakles for directions, Dionysos
  sets off to Hades' Halls, only to find Euripides engaged in a contest with Aeschylus,
  as to who was the greatest of them all. Dionysos sets himself the task of judging
  their weighty words, but more often than not these tragedians make him the butt
  of their jokes. 'Frogs' is a wonderful mix of the living and the dead, of the tragic
  and the comic.
